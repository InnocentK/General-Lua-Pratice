The following are comments regarding my code (not the execution as much as an explanation of the contents of the .lua file)

    All 8 problems are completed and should work without issue. 

    The functions for each of the problems are seperated in the code by comment headers (so that it is easier to scroll from one problem to another) and at the end of every problem there are a few lines that are commented out. 

    Those are some (I deleted most of them to increase readability but left a few) of the lines where I was doing testing of the funtions and I decided to leave some of the tests in case I need to fix or check on any of the functions
